Logistics:

Each week, there’s a lecture and a homework assignment.
We have two projects: in the middle of the class and a capstone project at the end. Those who complete these two projects get a certificate.
For homework, projects and other activities, you’ll get scores. At the end, we’ll publish the list of top 100 participants on our website.
The schedule and the plan are work in progress.
